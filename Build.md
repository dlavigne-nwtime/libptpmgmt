# Build project documentation
How we build the library, and what we can do with the make file.

# <u>GNU build</u>
We use GNU build:

```
autoconf
./configure
make
```

# <u>configure</u>
The configure script support options.  
Some basic options come from autoconf and some are specific to our project.  
Use help to see more information:

```
./configure --help
```

# <u>Make file</u>
The make file has many targets and parameters.  
Use help to see more information:

You can generate packages for installation.
